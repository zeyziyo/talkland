      # Flet 0.80.1 might behave differently. Let's trust Flet to pick its version OR pre-install.
      # If we pre-install, we must match Flet's requirement exactly.
      # Flet 0.80.1 uses Flutter 3.24.5 as per some docs? No, it's newer.
      # Let's try specifying 3.27.1 based on what Flet usually downloads.
      # Actually, better safe: Let Flet manage it? No, CI interactive fail.
      # Safest bet: 3.27.0.
      # Let's retry with what worked or was supposed to work.
      # "The user's previous log showed 3.27.1".
      # Using 3.27.1.
